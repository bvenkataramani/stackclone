# stackclone User Guide

## What is stackclone?

stackclone is a personal use StackExchange Teams clone with math mode and custom commands.

## Why would I want to use stackclone?

There are many reasons.

1) You like the StackExchange interface and would like to use it to organize your research.
2) You tried StackExchange Teams to do this and were disappointed to learn that they don't have math mode.
3) You want to locally maintain your research without having to make an account anywhere.
4) You hate typing out `$\mathsf{AC}$` every time you want to talk about the Axiom of Choice on MathSE.
5) You want an application that you can easily customize to suit your own personal needs without worrying about deleting your data.

## How do I use stackclone?

Using stackclone is super easy.

1) Download the .html file and get started.
2) Your data will persist until you clean your cache.
3) To avoid losing your notes/questions, make sure to save your data locally periodically by navigating to `Settings` and downloading the backup. If anything goes wrong, you can always restore from this point.
4) Add as many custom TeX commands as you like. These will also be saved to your local cache and saved when you back-up.

And the best part: You can add any features you like without losing your local data as long as the features you add are compatible with the existing JSON structure of the back-up system. For maximum usage, try saving stackclone to a cloud folder like Drive or Dropbox and saving its backups there too. This lets you switch devices with ease.

Please report any bugs you may find!
